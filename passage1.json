  "passage": "In studies of Indonesian (and more generally, Southeast Asian) Islam there has been little sympathy for or interest in the practice of Islamic law. Most Western scholars have taken Islamic law to be the rigid application of supposedly divine but actually arbitrary codes of behavior. But we should understand fiqh-the application of Islamic law—as a process of interpretation rather than a timeless body of rules. Shari'a is the God-prescribed \"path\" for humans to follow, as set out in the Qur'an and hadith-traditional sayings of the Prophet Muhammad-but figh is \"jurisprudence,\" the very human interpretive art of fitting a narrow range of Shari'a to the world. Figh practice is supposed to vary in different societies and cultures, taking into account custom as well as circumstance. Take inheritance as an example. Islamic law sets out clear procedures and rules for dividing an estate. People may or may not avail themselves of those rules; they just have to consult them. The laws are \"facilitative\" in that if people agree to do something other than what they suggest, then such a decision is by no means un-Islamic. Indeed, the recent Compilation of Islamic Law for Indonesia gives religious legal force to such decisions by consensus. Consider the analogy with U.S. inheritance law. If a person dies without a will the state will divide the property equally among heirs, but if the heirs agree to do otherwise such an agreement is not against the law. Moreover, religious judges take account of regional practices in rendering decisions. The law is meant to be interpreted in relationship to those customs. In Muslim West Sumatra one finds ancestral property passed down from mothers' brothers to sisters' sons. To Snouck Hurgronje, and indeed to many anthropologists today, this practice would be \"evidence for West Sumatrans' failure to 'receive' Islam into their culture.\" And yet the practice is endorsed by religious scholars who interpret the property as a pious trust (waqf) and thus outside the domain of inheritance law. One may quarrel with the interpretations-and many do-but it is a quarrel within the terms of figh.A second Indonesian example. The Compilation of Islamic Law I just mentioned recognizes the right of wives and husbands to equal shares of all property acquired during the marriage-joint or community property—a right based not on worldwide Islamic decisions or opinions but on local practice and culture. \"Custom is made into Islamic law\" as one of the compilation's authors put it. Religious law-making is cultural interpretation, in which judges and lawmakers have and make choices: for or against human rights, social tolerance, or gender equality. We are probably all legal realists: at home we think of U.S. judges as making law with values, prejudices, and local conditions, in mind. Why should we think differently about judges and law-making abroad? Behind sanctions of the Rushdie manhunt or rabbinical uses of the \"pursuer\" doctrine against Rabin were not \"Islamic law\" or \"Jewish law,\" but highly particular, and to us highly misguided, legal interpretations. Legal interpretations mean that the law can, of course, be misinterpreted. The point has been well made by students of Middle Eastern societies but it deserves to be made to a broader audience. We should also critically examine the folk models available in European and American cultures for the analysis of public religious pluralism. In Britain, France, Germany, and the United States, the law most likely has been shaped by folk beliefs and cultural practices. We should keep that in mind when we decide to judge the way Islamic law works.",
